Goal:
    - get the dev enviroment 
    - some coding 

Dev enviroment 
- an unix os
- gcc or clang      // c compiler
- nasm or fasm      // assmebler
- ld                // linker
- qemu or bochs     // emulator (bochs has a better debugger)
- vnc               // if using qemu-base
- dd,fdisk
- hex editor

- Idk how many of the above thing are going to be used,
- as u know its a mf*n journal

> ok so what now (idk).. 
- so power btn pressed > electricity flows
- BIOS/UEFI (tiny program buit into motherboard) wakes up
- BIOS/UEFI looks for a bootloader on ur drive
- bootloader finds and loads ur OS kernal
- kernal loads the rest of the OS

OK so thats what it is UMMMM
- so BIOS vs UEFI 
    BIOS: old simple starts in 16bit mode 
    UEFI: New fancy starts in 64-bit mode birectly

- Bootloader 
    - grub (linux use this)
    - its 512 bytes 

- kernal 
    - for now its a wet dream!!

So whats the plan tough chouice??
- BIOS for hardcore and biased reasons come on u know me 
- Grubbb lol we will write our own bootloader come on grub is too bloated 

> ok so we are going to start from bootloader 
> if ur wonder WHHY not BIOS cause its fitted in ur motherboard

- video Title: Making Simple Bootloader using x86 Assembly
- he explain this better than me 

> boot.asm    
bits 16             ; we are running in real mode
org 0x7c00          ; bios loads code at this address

mov si, 0

print:
    mov ah, 0x0e
    mov al, [hello + si]
    int 0x10
    add si, 1
    cmp [hello + si], 0
    jne print 

hello:
    db "hello world!", 0

times 510 - ($ - $$) db 0
dw 0xAA55

> now u have created the bootloader, whih is in 16bit real mode
> next u need is 32bit then 64bit that it 
> and the best part their is a yt tut which cover all this

> after completing this playlist which is about 1h u will build the kernal
> good luck!!

> a day in a c dev
> learn x86 asm which is pretty easy !! (bad humour)
> today was a more of a strugling day 
> i was using dwm and qemu didnt work there 
> half of the day went to figuring what to do
> so i have to switch to hyprland and it worked idk how
> moslty from now i think it will be asm 
> so quickly learn asm x86 (no good videos so u have to read /asm)

    (and why does assembly sound like some cement brand)
