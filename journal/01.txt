Intro
So today is day 1 of building my own os from scratch, really excited and lets go!! 

Why create an OS?
My initial goal was to understand linux from boot to shell how it handles everything
but before that i think i need to undersatnd how the f even an os work, and the best
way to do, is to create one from scratch 

Goal: implemented an os from scratch 

- create a prog that talk to cpu itself often called OS
- cpus intel/amd/arm and others
    Intel/AMD made x86 family
    ARM made ARM family
    Berkeley RISC-V
- Each CPU speaks a different language (instruction set)
- OS must speak the CPU's language

- selecting the architecture
    x86        x86 assembly     Must use x86 instructions
    RISC-V     RISC-V assembly  Must use RISC-V instructions

- 32bit vs 64bit
    32-bit OS: Can address 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 bytes ≈ 4GB
    64-bit OS: Can address 2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes ≈ 16 exabytes
Note* here its about addressable memory not installed ram

- x86 evolved through history:
    8086: 16-bit (1MB segmented memory)
    80386: 32-bit (4GB flat memory)
    x86-64: 64-bit (huge memory, but backward compatible)

- Today's x86 CPUs run in multiple modes:
    Real Mode: 16-bit (for booting)
    Protected Mode: 32-bit
    Long Mode: 64-bit

- architecture and bits
    For x86: Build for x86-64/Long Mode (not 32-bit protected mode)
    For RISC-V: Build for RV64GC (64-bit base with extensions)

- im going for 64 bit X86 for unknown and biased reason

end!
