# BINARY arithemetic

* 0 + 0 = 0
* 0 + 1 = 1
* 1 + 0 = 1
* 1 + 1 = 10

# Signed numbers

0000 0000 = +ve num
1000 0000 = -ve num

```txt
eg:
    0000 0010 = 2
    1111 1101 = one's compliment
    1111 1110 = two's compliment (one's compliment + 1)

now:
    1111 1110 = -2 
    0000 0001 = invert -2
    0000 0010 = add +1
```

* so 1111 1110 is -2 and 254
* it depends on operation which leads to signed or unsi
